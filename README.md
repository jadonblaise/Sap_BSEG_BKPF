# Sap_BSEG_BKPF
This task is focused on linking two tables BSEG and BKPF. You can find documentation on the tables here <a href="https://leanx.eu/en/sap/table/bkpf.html">BKPF - Accounting Document Header | LeanX</a>
The completeness of the data export should also be ensured. To do this, carry out all the tests that seem sensible to you. Also compare your data with the total balance list provided by the client (Susa_BergerUndCo.xlsx).

Result has to be in the following order:
An Excel file with the reconciliation.
Your Python code (as a script or notebook)
Possibly a text document with explanations
